        "Developed a machine learning pipeline in Python to analyze 2020 Chicago traffic crash data and predict primary contributory causes using tree-based classifiers.",
        "Performed large-scale data preparation and feature handling with Pandas and NumPy, integrating crash, vehicle, and people datasets containing over 100 input features.",
        "Trained and evaluated multiple classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Bagging classifiers, using accuracy and ROC-AUC to assess performance on imbalanced data.",
        "Achieved 78% prediction accuracy with a Random Forest model and visualized model behavior and outcomes using Matplotlib and Seaborn to support traffic safety analysis."
